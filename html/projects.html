                During April of 2020, I founded Locally Featured in response to the COVID pandemic. The company 
                started with one Instagram account highlighting locally-owned restaurants and other businesses. 
                During this time, these businesses needed platforms to reach members of their community. 
                <br> </br>
                By August 2021, I managed 7 Locally Featured accounts with a net following above 20,000. 
                This company managed Instagram accounts @oakvillefeatured, @burlingtonfeatured, 
                @kitchenerfeatured and more! You can visit these accounts on Instagram to see my past work! 
                <br> </br>
                This experience taught be so much about the real-world challenges of growing a business. I created my own 
                targetted content, managed sales of promotial posts and developed systems to automate tedious tasks.
