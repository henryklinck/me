            <h4>September 2022 - November 2023 <br></br> 
                Software Program Built with Java</h4>
            <img class="proj_image" src="../images/uoft_cs_logo.jpeg"></img>
            <p>72 Reviews is a fully-functional restaurant review program. The program allows users/restaurant owners to:
                register accounts, log-in, create restaurants, review restaurants, interact with other reviews, etc. 
                <br> </br>
                I built this program with five classmates using Java. The GUI of this project was built using Java Swing. 
                Object Oriented Programming, SOLID Design Patterns and Clean Architecture (Robert C. Martin, “Uncle Bob”) 
                Principles were implemented throughout this program. I primarily worked on the User Registration, 
                Log-in, User Entity Methods and GUI compenents of this program.
                <br> </br>
                This was the cumulative project for the course CSC207: Software Design. My group achieved a strong mark
                on this evaluation (89%).

                Virtual ASL Interpreter Built with Python & Javascript</h4>
            <img class="proj_image" src="../images/sign_stream_icon.jpeg"></img>
            <p>SignStream creates a *virtual ASL interpreter * that translates speech from online videos in real-time. 
                Users play videos or audio and an ASL translation is returned.
                <br> </br>
                I paricipated in the 2022 QHacks with two friends.
                I primarily contributed to the backend components of this project with JavaScript. I also web-scraped 
                various ASL (sign-language) libraries with Python Tools (Beautiful Soup).

            <h2>Locally Featured</h2>
            <h4>April 2020 - September 2021</h4>
            <img class="proj_image" src="../images/locally_featured_logo.jpg"></img>
            <p>
                During April of 2020, I founded Locally Featured in response to the COVID pandemic. The company 
                started with one Instagram account highlighting locally-owned restaurants and other businesses. 
                During this time, these businesses needed platforms to reach members of their community. 
                <br> </br>
                By August 2021, I managed 7 Locally Featured accounts with a net following above 20,000. 
                This company managed Instagram accounts <a href="https://www.instagram.com/oakvillefeatured/">@oakvillefeatured</a>,  
                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/burlingtonfeatured/">@burlingtonfeatured</a>,  
                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kitchener.featured/">@kitchenerfeatured</a> and more! 
                <br> </br>
                This experience taught be so much about the real-world challenges of growing a business. I created my own 
                targetted content, managed sales of promotial posts and developed systems to automate tedious tasks.
